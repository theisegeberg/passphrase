# Support

You're more than welcome to write me an e-mail on theis@theisegeberg.com or do a PR here if you have suggestions or changes. The app doesn't come with any guarantees and honestly I only use it because I built it myself. Otherwise I'd suggest just rolling dice and picking words from a word list.

I'll keep maintaining this app, because it's not a lot of work.

Because you just shouldn't trust any binary. You've got no idea what a compiled binary is, so download the source code and compile it yourself.

Will I make mac version? Most likely yes.
