# TFH Passphrase

TFH Passphrase is a small iOS app for generating and ranking human-friendly passphrases. It assembles candidate passphrases from a word list and scores them using ergonomic and similarity heuristics so you can pick options that are easier to type and remember without sacrificing length.

You can build it yourself or download it from the app store.

Why did I build this? Because I couldn't find a good open source passphrase generator.

## Features
- Generate candidate passphrases from a word list
- Built-in heuristics ("scorers") for typing ergonomics and character similarity

## Don't trust the code?
Included is a `audit.sh` script you can run to see for yourself. There could be hidden backdoors leaking out any passphrase you're creating. So by all means, check it through. Have a look in the audit.sh script also before you run it.

## Support

You're more than welcome to write me an e-mail on theis@theisegeberg.com or do a PR here if you have suggestions or changes. The app doesn't come with any guarantees and honestly I only use it because I built it myself. Otherwise I'd suggest just rolling dice and picking words from a word list.

I'll keep maintaining this app, because it's not a lot of work.

Will I make mac version? Most likely yes.
