# TFH Passphrase

TFH Passphrase is a small iOS app for generating and ranking human-friendly passphrases. It assembles candidate passphrases from a word list and scores them using ergonomic and similarity heuristics so you can pick options that are easier to type and remember without sacrificing length.

You can build it yourself or download it from the app store.

## Features
- Generate candidate passphrases from a word list
